# Download All The Instagram Images

---
## Instructions
* Search for the account name here -> http://picbear.online/
* Proceed to load all of the users images by scrolling to the very bottom of the screen, where no more images load. 
* Open up developer tools for your browser and copy all of the relevant HTML into a text file. 
* Load up the python script in an IDE, ensure that you have all the right libraries, rename in the input text file path and run it. 

## Warnings
This program will also download preview stills of video posts.
You should be using an adblocker or else you shall see advertisment images as well, which you probably don't want to download.
The code is so simple it names the files without any leading zeros.
If you want to delete the "pointless" opencv code, be warned that most of the instagram images don't have metadata which means most of your editor / viewing programs will hate them. Easy fix is to compress them a tad, and resave to create valid metadata.
