A guide how to download ALL the instagram images from a public instagram account, using Python and nifty tricks.

Search for the account name here.

Proceed to load all of the users images by scrolling to the very bottom of the screen, where no more images load. You should be using an adblocker or else you shall see advertisment images as well, which you probably don't want to download.

With no more images loading, open up developer tools for your browser and copy all of the relevant html into a text file. 

It's time to get started with Python. Load up the script from the file, ensure that you have all the right libraries installed and functioning, and run it. 

This program will also download preview stills of video posts.
